   <h2> Once upon a time, i was born!</h2><br />

 <p>
   Then life and all that happened...cause you know, it's kinda the whole point.<br />
   I knew that life has more to offer than just having fun with friends and family.<br />
   I knew that i have a calling! (dramatic trumpets!).<br />
   And so i began searching far and wide for my calling.<br />
   At first i thought my calling would be in the army, so i did my best, tried getting into the best unit i could. <br />
   And what do you know, i managed to become a warrior in a really badass unit and i was even an officer.<br />
   But it was not my calling, it was fun and all and it helped me discover things about myself that i would never had known if not my service, but it was not quite it you know.<br />

 </p>

 <p>
   Anyway, I finished my service and in a really weird timing because there was a war and everything but i started to really think, what will i do!? <br />
   I want to work, i want to succeed and have be able to give my wife and kids a high quality life but i gotta start somewhere.<br />
   I also knew that i want to be there for my family, i want to work in job that brings good money, but also allows flexibility with the hours of work and locations.<br />
 </p>
 
 <P>
   When i started asking my friends and family about it they all said that it sounds like i am aiming to the "High-Tech" industry.<br />
   Well, i didn't know much about it back than (I still don't, to be honest), but i began reading and talking to some people i know who work in High-tech places and what do you know, <br/>
   It's not all pink and gold of course, but it did sound like a place that fits to my definition of a perfect industry.<br />
   As i began to look more and more, i began to realize how big this industry really is, and the amount of different jobs one can find in the High-tech industry. <br />

   A good friend of mine who is a programmer himself, recommended me about a Udemy course by Angela yu, and i bought it and started working on it.<br />
   Aaaaaand i really liked it! I had so much fun writing codes and learning about everything you can do with just yourself, a computer, and the internet!/<br />
   So i set up this website as well as many other projects which you can check in this website.<br />
   Hope you enjoy my works and that you will find then efficient and aesthetically appealing, i put a lot of effort into them! <br />
